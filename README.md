The Submission


The uploaded file shows a rotating fractal tree that is scaled by the number of people on the floor. When a person steps on the floor, the background color changes along with the color of the tree. The purpose of thise project is to illustrate the many patterns that can be created on a fractal tree when different rotational speeds (in radians) are applied to each branch. For instance, when the angle is equal to PI/2, the tree has an appearence of a dragon Curve.
